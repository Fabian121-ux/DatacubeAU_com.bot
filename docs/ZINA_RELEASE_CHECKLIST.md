# Zina Release Checklist

What remains before Fabian can begin controlled real-world WhatsApp testing (see `docs/ZINA_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` for the full per-domain detail behind each line here, and `docs/ZINA_CONTROLLED_TEST_PLAN.md`, once written, for the staged test procedure itself).

Last verified: 2026-09-08, against `main` @ `0034587a90bb8d5a79bda41e85091cfea33b969d`.

## Engineering gates (mechanical — re-verify every run)

- [x] Full migration chain (001 → latest) applies cleanly from an empty database
- [x] Full pytest suite green
- [x] Coverage at or above the repository gate (57%; currently 75.12%)
- [x] DB leakage = 0 across all `CLEANUP_MODELS`/`CLEANUP_RAW_TABLES` tables
- [x] No known P0 outbound-authority regressions
- [x] No duplicate outbound delivery paths (single fail-closed fence, confirmed)
- [x] No unsafe blind retries on uncertain delivery
- [x] Exactly one router, one scheduler, one tool dispatcher (confirmed, no duplicates found)
- [x] Exact-head CI green on `main`

## Product/architecture gates (real work remaining)

- [ ] **Command Center governs all commands.** `ReplyRule` currently absorbs owner-created custom commands (`/create-command` writes to `ReplyRule`, not `CommandCatalogEntry`) — this must be fixed before commands are "discoverable and governed" in the way the mission requires. See roadmap Phase 5.
- [ ] **Identity Registry has real CRUD.** No delete, no search, no provenance field, and the core matching logic (`score_entry`) has zero direct test coverage. See roadmap Phase 1.
- [ ] **FAQ has per-entry lifecycle management**, not just bulk document replace. See roadmap Phase 3.
- [ ] **Knowledge Base documents can be edited, deleted, and disabled** — currently only upload and reindex exist; once uploaded, a document is effectively permanent. See roadmap Phase 4.
- [ ] **Dashboard coverage for Scheduled Actions and Private Media Artifacts** — both have complete, tested backend APIs but zero UI. See roadmap Phase 6.
- [ ] **Tool Registry / Authority Engine covers Internet access.** `web.search` is registered but has no dispatcher adapter; `InternetService` is called directly by the reply planner, bypassing the deterministic authority boundary the mission requires for all tool execution. See roadmap Phase 9 / 15.
- [ ] **Conversation observability captures the outbound-authorization outcome in the same audit row as the rest of the decision**, and exposes a real `internet_used` flag and (once Tool Registry covers more than WhatsApp sends) tools-proposed-vs-executed. See roadmap Phase 7.

## Explicitly out of scope for TEST READY (deferred, not blocking)

- Private byte storage for media (Phase 11 layer 2) — retention stays OFF regardless; `.vv`/`.vvopen` already work against live WAHA-provided transient capabilities without needing durable storage.
- AI Media Intelligence / `DerivedArtifact` (Phase 12) — not started, not required for text/command-based controlled testing.
- Project Intelligence (Phase 14) — not started; Fabian's projects continue to answer via static Identity Registry entries in the meantime, which is a known, acceptable limitation for early testing.
- True embedding-based semantic retrieval for FAQ/Knowledge (currently lexical/fuzzy) — functional, just not literally "semantic."

## Staged test plan

Not yet written. `docs/ZINA_CONTROLLED_TEST_PLAN.md` should be produced once the product/architecture gates above are cleared, defining Stage A (OWNER self-DM text only) through Stage E (one explicitly approved external test contact), per the mission's explicit staging requirement. Do not skip stages.

## Live safety reminder

None of the gaps above are WhatsApp-facing safety gaps — Phase 10 (outbound safety) is already production-grade and independently verified across PRs #43/#41/#44/#45. The remaining work is entirely about Fabian being able to *see and manage* Zina's behavior safely (dashboard completeness, command governance, observability accuracy) before he starts talking to it for real.
